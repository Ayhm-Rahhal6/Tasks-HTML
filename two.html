    <h1>What Is the Difference Between <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/html-css"> HTML and CSS?</a></h1>
    <p><b> 1) The main difference between HTML and CSS is that while HTML defines the structure of web pages, CSS is used to style those pages with a variety of different features. If we think of HTML code as the skeleton of a web page, CSS would be its skin.</b></p>

    <h2>Other differences between <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">HTML</a> and CSS include:</h2>
    <p><b>2) <u>HTML. consists of text contained within HTML tags</u>, while <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/">CSS</a> is made up of declaration blocks and selectors Where HTML gives a web browser duplay taformation of varions tags,

        <u>CS5 enhances that information to the browser</u> by adding styling to those HTML tag
        
        <u>CSS can be med inside an HTML document</u>, but HTML. cannot be used inside a CSS sheet
        
        <u>CSS feed for presentation and vional effect</u> to manipulate colors, fonts, and backgrounds, add visual style to sites, prepare images, specify margins and borders, and much more while HTML is not</b></p>

        <p>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.[4] Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.[5]

            The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags",[6] first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.[7][8] It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.[9]
            
            HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visible or audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 Techniques for using SGML, which describes the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visible or audible web pages.

    <p><mark>A software engineer usually is responsible for the same tasks as a developer plus broader responsibilities of software engineering including architecting and designing new features and applications</mark>, targeting new platforms, managing the software development lifecycle (design, implementation, testing, and deployment), leading a team of programmers, communicating with customers, managers and other engineers, considering system stability and quality, <u>and exploring software development methodologies.</u></p>
    <p>The first company founded specifically to provide software products and services was the Computer Usage Company in 1955. Before that time, computers were programmed either by customers or the few commercial computer manufacturers of the time, such as Sperry Rand and IBM.[10]

        The software industry expanded in the early 1960s, almost immediately after computers were first sold in mass-produced quantities. Universities, governments, and businesses created a demand for software. Many of these programs were written in-house by full-time staff programmers; some were distributed between users of a particular machine for no charge, while others were sold on a commercial basis. Other firms, such as Computer Sciences Corporation (founded in 1959), also started to grow. Computer manufacturers soon started bundling operating systems, system software and programming environments with their machines; the IBM 1620 came with the 1620 Symbolic Programming System and FORTRAN.[11]
        
        The industry expanded greatly with the rise of the personal computer (PC) in the mid-1970s, which brought computing to the average office worker. <mark>In the following years, the PC also helped create a constantly growing market for games</mark>, applications and utility software. This resulted in increased demand for software developers for that period of time.[12]</p>

    <p>High-level languages made the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable, and less bound to the underlying hardware. The first compiler related tool, the A-0 System, was developed in 1952[13] by Grace Hopper, who also coined the term 'compiler'.[14][15] FORTRAN, the first widely used high-level language to have a functional implementation, came out in 1957,[16] and many other languages were soon developed—in particular, COBOL aimed at commercial data processing, and Lisp for computer research.

        These compiled languages allow the programmer to write programs in terms that are syntactically richer, and more capable of abstracting the code, making it easy to target varying machine instruction sets via compilation declarations and heuristics. Compilers harnessed the power of computers to make programming easier[16] by allowing programmers to specify calculations by entering a formula using infix notation. <br><br>

        See also: Computer programming in the punched card era
        Programs were mostly entered using punched cards or paper tape. By the late 1960s, data storage devices and computer terminals became inexpensive enough that programs could be created by typing directly into the computers. Text editors were also developed that allowed changes and corrections to be made much more easily than with punched cards.</p>

    <p>“Ok, so now I know what programming is, but what’s coding? I’m here to learn how to code. Are they the same thing?”

        While sometimes used interchangeably, programming and coding actually have different definitions. 
        
        Programming is the mental process of thinking up instructions to give to a machine (like a computer).
        Coding is the process of transforming those ideas into a written language that a computer can understand.
        Over the past century, humans have been trying to figure out how to best communicate with computers through different programming languages. Programming has evolved from punch cards with rows of numbers that a machine read, to drag-and-drop interfaces that increase programming speed, with lots of other methods in between.<p>
